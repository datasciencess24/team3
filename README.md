## Overview

- Our explainable fusion model for grinding anomaly detection allows for observed anomalies to be more easily linked to their root causes in real time, striking the ideal balance between accuracy, interpretability and efficiency.  
- It comprises a convolutional neural network (CNN) and decision tree (DT) 
- Our experiments demonstrate that this fusion model performs significantly better than other explainable alternatives, namely a parallel CNN-DT fusion model, CNN with heat map, DT used alone and regularised logistic regression.


## Structure

/Data_Loader includes

/Models contains both of our models that will be trained and tested both jointly and separately

/Trainer includes

/Data contains both the data-files that are classified as ok and those that are classified as not-ok

## Data

The training date consits of 29 normal/ok data-sets and 29 not-ok data-sets, given in the data folder.

## Project status
