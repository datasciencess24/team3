In this code:

Net is the CNN. It has two convolutional layers, each followed by a max pooling layer, and three fully connected layers.
nn.Conv1d(1, 64, 5) creates a convolutional layer with 1 input channel, 64 output channels, and a kernel size of 5.
nn.MaxPool1d(2) creates a max pooling layer with a kernel size of 2.
nn.Linear(128 * 22, 120) creates a fully connected layer with 128 * 22 input features and 120 output features. The number 128 * 22 is the number of features output by the last convolutional layer, and may need to be adjusted based on the size of your wavelet-transformed recordings.
nn.MSELoss() creates a mean squared error loss function, which is suitable for a regression task like predicting the rest of a recording.
optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9) creates a stochastic gradient descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a momentum of 0.9.
for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0): is a loop that iterates over your wavelet-transformed recordings. You'll need to replace trainloader with your actual data loader.
inputs, labels = data gets the inputs and labels from the current batch of data. The inputs should be the first 90% of each wavelet-transformed recording, and the labels should be the rest of each recording.
optimizer.zero_grad() zeroes the gradient buffers of all parameters.
outputs = net(inputs) passes the inputs through the network and gets the outputs.
loss = criterion(outputs, labels) computes the loss between the outputs and the labels.
loss.backward() computes the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters.
optimizer.step() updates the parameters based on the gradients.
